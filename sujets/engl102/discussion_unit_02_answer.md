**1. What are the benefits of using sentence variety in writing?**  
  
Using different kinds of sentences (short, long, simple, and complex) helps make writing engaging and easy to follow. In this paper, Putnam didn’t just write long, complicated sentences. He used short, clear statements to make a point, then followed up with more detailed ones. This use of sentence variety keeps the paper a little more engaging and helps make hard ideas easier to understand.  

**2. How do coordination and subordination contribute to the structure and coherence of sentences and paragraphs?**  
  
Putnam used coordination to connect equally important ideas. For example, when he said,  
  
“Peirce emphasises the importance of conceiving of the knowing subject as a _community_. But the difference from the positivists is even greater when we come to the issue of conclusive verification”,  
  
he used coordinating conjunctions to guide the flow of his message from one thought to the next one.  
  
Subordination is used when he introduced less central ideas:

“Although textbooks tend to treat pragmatism primarily as a theory of truth... it is important to remember that the principle that the classical pragmatists actually regarded as basic was Peirce's so-called 'pragmatic maxim' and that the theories of truth that Peirce and James advanced were regarded by them simply as applications of this maxim...” This structure connects the important point and the less important idea.  
  
**3. Why is parallelism important in writing? How does it contribute to clarity and impact?**  
  
Dreyer (2019)  states that "parallelism is the principle that parts of a sentence that are parallel in meaning should be parallel in construction (p. 89). Putnam used this technique effectively when outlining philosophical contrasts:  
  
 “...the pragmatists applied their pragmatic maxim to whole metaphysical systems and to ethical and religious beliefs as well as to scientific utterances and theories.”  
  
The repetition of “to” followed by a noun phrase creates a smooth, balanced, and clear sentence. Parallel structure makes these elements easier to process and reinforces their connection.
