#### **1. What are the benefits of using sentence variety in writing?**

Using different kinds of sentences (short, long, simple, complex) helps make writing engaging and easy to follow. In this article, Putnam didn’t just write long, complicated sentences like many philosophers do. He sometimes used short, clear statements to make a point, then follows up with more detailed ones. This use of sentence variety keeps the reader’s attention and helps make hard ideas easier to understand.
#### **2. How do coordination and subordination contribute to the structure and coherence of sentences and paragraphs?**

Putnam used **coordination** to connect related ideas with equal weight. For example, when he said, “...Peirce emphasized the importance of conceiving of the knowing subject as a community. But the difference from the positivists is even greater when we come to the issue of conclusive verification,” he used coordinating conjunctions to guide the flow of his message from one thought to the next one.

Subordination is used when he introduced less central ideas or qualifications: “Although textbooks tend to treat pragmatism primarily as a theory of truth... it is important to remember...” This structure focuses his important point, while giving context through the subordinate clause.

#### **3. Why is parallelism important in writing? How does it contribute to clarity and impact?**

Parallelism is key in emphasizing comparisons and series of related elements. Putnam uses this technique effectively when outlining philosophical contrasts:

> “...the pragmatists applied their pragmatic maxim to whole metaphysical systems and to ethical and religious beliefs as well as to scientific utterances and theories.”

The repetition of “to” followed by a noun phrase creates a smooth, rhythmical sentence that clearly outlines the scope of application. Parallel structure makes these elements easier to process and reinforces their connection.
