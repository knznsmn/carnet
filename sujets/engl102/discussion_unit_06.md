#### Discussion Responses

---

It is your responsibility to respond to two classmates by providing comments, asking questions, or having a conversation about their main post. Feedback should be appropriate, meaningful, and helpful. For instance, refer to how your own experience supports/contradicts the opinions developed by your peers. If you think they are too general or not rooted enough in personal experience, you may also ask for more detailed examples supporting these opinions. In particular, make sure that the examples provided are properly referenced and that you are able to access them. Overall, your comments should contribute positively to the conversation by broadening or clarifying it. Feedback should be at least 3-4 complete sentences (at least 100 words). Feedback should be in complete sentences. Read '[Peer feedback for students](https://my.uopeople.edu/pluginfile.php/1976260/mod_forum/intro/Peer%20Feedback%20for%20students.pdf)' to know more about how to give feedback.

If at any time you suspect that a post in this Discussion Forum violates UoPeople's rules regarding plagiarism and/or any aspect of UoPeople’s Academic Code of Conduct, please notify your instructor immediately.

Remember that your instructor will be grading this assignment.
