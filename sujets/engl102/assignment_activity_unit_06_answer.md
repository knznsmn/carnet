## Part 1: Persuasive Paragraph
I am currently studying computer science at this university. I like the program because it is completely online, which makes it the ideal environment for me to focus and learn at my own pace. However, the one major issue I’ve encountered is the programming language used to teach us programming—Java. Java often takes precedence as the introductory language due to its object-oriented design and widespread industry use. While this makes sense from a practical perspective, it may inadvertently sideline the profound educational benefits of starting with C. Unlike Java, which abstracts many low-level operations, C requires students to directly manipulate memory, pointer arithmetic, and system-level programming. These crucial elements are often hidden when the low-level details of how computers operate are hidden behind abstraction layers. This hands-on approach in C results to a much deeper understanding of how software interacts with hardware, cultivating essential problem-solving skills that are difficult to develop when working solely in a high-level environment.

Cheng (2011) argues that C is not only foundational to modern information technology and computer science but is also the most widely used language in the industry. This makes C relevant for students pursuing careers in science, engineering, and systems programming. Furthermore, learning C enhances a programmer’s adaptability. The language’s simplicity and efficiency push learners to write optimized code—a skill that is both transferable to other programming languages and crucial for applications where performance matters. According to Mishra, (2024), C's portability allows programs to run on various platforms with minimal modification, making it ideal for developing cross-platform software. This trait is invaluable in today’s diverse technological landscape, where developers need to build applications for everything from embedded devices to high-performance servers.

Additionally, the discipline required to manage resources explicitly in C leads to more mindful, deliberate coding practices. There are no automatic garbage collections. The responsibility falls entirely on the programmer. While this may seem intimidating at first, it instills a discipline and attention to detail that can significantly improve a developer's long-term effectiveness. Java’s abstraction may simplify the initial learning curve, but it also obscures the underlying mechanics of programming. In contrast, C offers a transparent view into how each line of code translates into machine-level operations. This kind of understanding is invaluable—not only for writing efficient software but for grasping how computers actually work.

Moreover, a useful understanding of computing must involve more than just using pre-built objects and classes. It should begin with learning how data is represented, how memory is managed, and how control flows at the most fundamental level—all of which C teaches directly. This foundational knowledge not only demystifies programming but also equip students to venture into more complex fields like embedded systems, operating system development, and high-performance computing. Because of this, integrating C into the early stages of computer science education provides a more robust and versatile foundation for aspiring programmers than Java alone can offer.
