Balancing schoolwork and a full-time job has taught me to use technology wisely to stay organized and productive. I do most of my reading and coding lessons on my Linux desktop at home. I copy the reading materials into LibreOffice Writer and save it as a PDF. I then read these PDFs while riding the bus to and from work, which takes about an hour each way. This helps me use my travel time to keep up with my studies.

For note-taking, I use Obsidian. Itâ€™s a helpful app that lets me link ideas together and review them easily. It makes studying feel more connected and less overwhelming. To stay focused, I also use the Forest app. This app uses a timer that follows the Pomodoro method, helping me work in short, focused sessions without getting distracted. This approach matches what Weinstein and Hume (2009) suggest about using structured study times to stay focused and motivated.

By using simple, free tools and managing my time well, I can handle my assignments better and finish my writing tasks on time. These strategies show how technology, when used wisely, can make a big difference in learning and enhance writing success.
