**AI and Global Job Losses: A Nuanced Impact**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global workforce, leading to both concern and opportunity. While fears of job losses are not unfounded, the reality is more nuanced. Talmage-Rostron (2024), AI quoted a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs expected to displace some jobs, but may also mean new jobs and a productivity boomâ€”highlighting the shifting nature of employment rather than outright elimination. He also quoted Forbes citing MIT and Boston University report, that AI will replace as many as two million manufacturing workers by 2025.

Yossi Sheffi (2024) from MIT adds depth to this discussion by arguing that AI should be seen as a complement rather than a substitute for human labor. In supply chain management and logistics, for example, AI enhances efficiency but still requires human judgment for complex decision-making and relationship-building. Sheffi suggests that successful companies will adopt AI to augment human capabilities rather than replace them.

Similarly, an article from the Harvard Business Review warns that companies overly reliant on AI to cut labor costs risk long-term damage. It emphasizes that those who invest in integrating AI with human talent tend to outperform those who focus solely on automation (Tabrizi & Pahlavan, 2023). This reinforces the idea that while AI may lead to some job displacement, the broader trend is toward transformation and re-skilling rather than mass unemployment.
